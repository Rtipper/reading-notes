# Class 6 Notes _ JS Exercise

### Summary of Section
- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
- The HTML script element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the link element can be used to load a CSS file).
- If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.

### General Notes
- The general process of installing goes from HTML to CSS to JavaScript
- These 3 make up the elements of a webpage, starting with structure, then color/design then animation.
- Working in one file with these three languages, requires them all to be correctly interlinked through commands.
- Each element of the page will flesh itself out as they are written and connected (HTML to CSS to JS)
