# Class 5 - Notes for CSS Color

- The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways: RGB, Hex Codes & Color Names.
- RGB: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
- Hex Codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80.
- Color Names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan.
- Background Color: By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background is white you can use the background-color property on the body element.

### Understanding Color
- Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker (RGB).
- Using a program like Photoshop can confirm the RGB values of a color to be expressed within your code.
- When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
