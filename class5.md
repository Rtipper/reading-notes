# Class 5 - Notes for CSS Color

- The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways: RGB, Hex Codes & Color Names.
- RGB: These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. For example: rgb(100,100,90)
- Hex Codes: These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. For example: #ee3e80.
- Color Names: There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan.
- Background Color: By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background is white you can use the background-color property on the body element.

### Understanding Color
- Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker (RGB).
- Using a program like Photoshop can confirm the RGB values of a color to be expressed within your code.
- When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
- Opacity: l CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).

### CSS3: HSL Colors
- CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.
- Hue: Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
- Saturation: Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
- Lightness: Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity.

### CSS3: HSL & HSLA
- The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors. The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside parentheses for: HUE, SATURATION & LIGHTNESS

### Summary Notes
- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
