### Revisions and the Cloud
- Localized Version Control (VCS) - A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
- Centralized Version Control (CVS) - This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients, allowing programmers to have more knowledge of team members’ activities with certain files
- Distributed Version Control - If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
- Snapshots - Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.
- Local Operations - Git mostly relies on local operations allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.
- Tracking Changes - Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.
- States - Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed (Data is securely stored in a local database), modified (File has been changed but not committed to the database) and staged (Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot).
- Local Repository Structure - The local Git repository has three components: Working Directory (The actual files reside here), Index (The area used for staging) and Head (Points to the most recent commit)
- Tracked files can be modified, unmodified, or staged; they were part of the most recent file snapshot.
- Untracked files were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.
- To determine the state of files, utilize the git status command: $ git status
- Track one file only by using the following format: git add filename
- Track all files in a repository by using the following command: $ git add *
- After staging one or multiple files, you should commit the changes and record what you did within the commit message: $ git commit -m “made change x,y,z”
- Committing All Changes: $ git commit -a
- Push changes to a remote repository: $ git push origin master
