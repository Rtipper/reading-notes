# Reading Notes pt2. - Computer Architecture and Logic

- Computers started out as just calculators.
- Computers today still do the 4 same basic functions (input, storage, processing and output).
- A bit is the smallest form of data a computer can store.
- Any number can be represented with 1s and 0s.
- More wires = more numbers within a computer.
- Text, image and sound can be represented via binary (1s & 0s)
- Pixles break down to colors, which further break down to number values
- Sound can also be broken down into sound, based on a bit system.
- Circuts work to modify and process input information to output something different.
- There are multiple types of circuts that perform different functions for outputting input data.
- CPU is the master chip that controls all other parts of the computer
- Software programming is a more up-to-date version of working with binary.
- The computers OS is the master program controlling the rest of the software.
