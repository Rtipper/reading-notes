### LOOPS
- Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops.
- For: If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a for loop.
- While: If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop.
- Do While: The do...while loop is very similar to the while loop, but it has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly breaces at least once, even if fales.
