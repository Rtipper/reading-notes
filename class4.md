# Class 4 - Notes for Designing a Site

*From HTML & CSS by Duckett - Chpt 18*

### General Notes
- Focus on target audience (age, income, location).
- Make sure what information they are seeking in clear and easy to access.
- Consider how often they will be viewing your site.
- Site Map: Create a diagram for the full layout of the site including where specific buttons and clicks will take viewers.
- Don't hesitate to duplicate the same information more than once if it needs to appear on multiple pages.
- Remember to focus on the goals that your viewers should want to achieve by accessing the site (purchasing items, viewing specific information, etc.).
- Wireframes: Simple sketch mock of the site, like the map, that visually helps set the pace for where viewers will go by interacting with aspects of the site (i.e. I click on "Info" it leads to another page with multiple other paths, either forwards, backwards or sideways) as well as what each specific page will look like.
- Wireframes help ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.
- The wireframes make design easier because you know what information needs to appear on which page before considering how the the page should look.
- It can be very helpful to show the wireframes of a site to a client before showing them a design.

### Getting Your Message Across
- Content: With so much on the page, the designer needs to organize and prioritize the information to communicate their message and help users find what they're looking for.
- Prioritizing: Designers create something known as a visual hierarchy to help users focus on the key messages that will draw people's attention, and then guide them to subsequent messages.
- Organzing: Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler (and easier to understand). Users should be able to identify the purpose of each block without processing each individual item. By presenting certain types of information in a similar visual style (such as using the same style for all buttons or all links), users will learn to associate that style with a particular type of content.

### Visual Hierarchy
- Control the flow of the page through all visual elements.
- Size: Larger elements will grab users attention first. For this reason it is a good idea to make headings and key points relatively large.
- Color: Foreground and background color can draw attention to key messages. Brighter sections tend to draw users' attention first.
- Style: An element may be the same size and color as surrounding content but have a different style applied to it to make it stand out.

### Designing Navigation
- Concise: Ideally, the navigation should be quick and easy to read. It is a good idea to try to limit the number of options in a menu to no more than eight links. These can link to section homepages which in turn link to other pages.
- Clear: Users should be able to predict the kind of information that they will find on the page before clicking on the link. Where possible, choose single descriptive words for each link rather than phrases.
- Selective: The primary navigation should only reflect the sections or content of the site. Functions like logins and search, and legal information like terms and conditions and so on are best placed elsewhere on the page.

### Summary from Chapter 18
- It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
