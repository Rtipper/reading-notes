# Class 7 Notes - 

- ACCESS CONTENT:
You can use JavaScript to select any
element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. For example:
• Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page
• Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note
• Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of ema i 1 
- MODIFY CONTENT:
You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them. For example:
• Add a paragraph of text after the
first h1 element
• Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements
• Change the size or position of an
img element
- PROGRAM RULES:
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page. For example:
• A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
• A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a form, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
• An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area.
- REACT TO EVENTS:
You can specify that a script should run
when a specific event has occurred. For
example, it could be run when:
• A button is pressed
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on
• A cursor hovers over an element
• Information is added to a form
• An interval of time has passed
• A web page has finished loadin.
- Access the content of the page
- Modify the content of the page
- Program rules or instructions the browser can follow
- React to events triggered by the user or browser

### FORMS
Validating forms (checking whether they have been
filled in correctly) is important when information is
supplied by users. JavaScript lets you alert the user
if mistakes have been made. It can also perform
sophisticated calculations based on any data entered
and reveal the results to the user.
React: User presses the submit button when they
have entered their name

**Access:** Get value from form field
**Program:** Check that the name is long enough
**Modify:** Show a warning message if the name is not
long enough

### RELOAD PART OF PAGE
You might not want to force visitors to reload the
content of an entire web page, particularly if you
only need to refresh a small portion of a page.
Just reloading a section of the page can make a
site feel like it is faster to load and more like an
application.

**React:** Script triggered when user clicks on link
**Access:** The link that they clicked on
**Program:** load the new content that was requested
from that link
**Access:** Find the element to replace in the page
**Modify:** Replace that content with the new content

### A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS
- **RECIPES:** By following the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before. Some scripts are simple and only deal with one individual scenario, like a simple recipe for a basic dish. Other scripts can perform many tasks, like a recipe for a complicated three-course meal. Another similarity is that, if
you are new to cooking or programming, there is a lot of new terminology to learn.

### WRITING A SCRIPT
- A script is just a series of short instructions, each of which is performed in order to solve the problem in hand. This is why creating a script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time.
- Define the Goal: you need to define the task you want to
achieve, much like a puzzle for the computer to solve.
- Design the Script: To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this
puzzle. 
- Code Each Step: Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

### DESIGNING A SCRIPT
- Break the problem down into individual tasks. An example of this might be how a maid cleans a hotel room.
- Step 1: Remove used bedding
- Step 2: Wipe all surfaces
- Step 3: Vacuum floors
- Every step for every task shown in a flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand and follow.
- The first thing you should do is detail your goals for the script (what you want it to achieve).
- Next, break it into a series of tasks that have to be
performed in order to achieve the goals.
- Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations.
You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together.
The flowcharts show the paths between each step.

### EXPRESSIONS:

- In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be
given a value. "var color - 'beige';" means the value of the color is now beige.
- When you first declare a variable using the var keyword, it is given a special value of undefined. This will change when you assign a value to it.
- You can perform operations on any number of individual values (see next page) to determine a single value. For example: "var area = 3 * 2;" means the value of the area is now 6.
